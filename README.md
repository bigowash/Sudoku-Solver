# Sudoku-Solver

This was a computing project exploring my skills in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The webapp takes a 81 character sudoku string and provides options that solve the sudoku.

Each button communicates through a server using ajax. The request contains the solving method and the sudoku board containing all of the options and the response contains the revised sudoku board which is then updated on the user interface.
